# My-Pvz
Manual Implementation of Pvz Hammer Zombie Game in C++

The project improves on an existing project.The original code URL is https://codebus.cn/jihe/pvz

The project earned an A in my fall semester C++ programming course, which was 94/100

**Here are the features I added:**
- Split the code which has only one source file by class idea and logic, convenient for modification and subsequent maintenance.
- Fix the bug that zombies eat plants and get stuck
- Add text description of game rules

Open https://github.com/Elapsedf/My-Pvz/releases/tag/1.0 to download the 1.0 version and open the Mypvz.exe to play the game!But now the game can only run on the windows

**Hope you can enjoy it.And If this program helps you, thanks for giving me a STAR!**
