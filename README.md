# My-Pvz
Manual Implementation of Pvz Hammer Zombie Game in C++

The project improves on an existing project.The original code URL is https://codebus.cn/jihe/pvz

**Here are the features I added:**
- Split the code which has only one source file by class idea and logic, convenient for modification and subsequent maintenance.
- Fix the bug that zombies eat plants and get stuck
- Add text description of game rules
